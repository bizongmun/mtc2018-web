              In the 4 years since it was first released, the Mercari marketplace application has been downloaded over 75 million times globally and has grown to a point where it now handles over 10 billion yen in transactions each month.
              Our speakers will reflect on Mercari’s development, offering a developer’s perspective on the company’s different technical strategies, team structures, and development processes.
              They will also give us an introduction to the technical challenges they plan to tackle from here on.
